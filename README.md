# Portfolio
This is a portfoilo of some of the various skills that I have. I have experience with tutoring, customer service, explaining complex material to laymen, statistics, coding in R, coding in SQL, and coding in Python.

The projects are labeled. Each will have a file of the write up for laymen, a file for the code if applicable, and a writeup for those more familiar with statistics.

The Brief Portfolio is intended for those that do not have much time to assess my skills. It has a write up of how I handle difficult situations, my capstone, and a write up of how I would improve a survey. The write up of handling difficult situations and improving a survey shows you how I think, while my cpastone showcases my data analysis skills.

The How I think is the section all about on how I think. No code will be in this section and it will be entirely of write ups of my thought process.

The MentalHealthAndViolence is my capstone.
