# Portfolio
This is a portfoilo of some of the various skills that I have. I have experience with tutoring, customer service, explaining complex material to laymen, statistics, coding in R, coding in SQL, and coding in Python.

The projects are labeled. Each will have a file of the write up for laymen, a file for the code if applicable, and a writeup for those more familiar with statistics.
