This section shows how I think and how I approach problems. This section will not have any code and will consist mostly of papers 1 to 2 pages in length.
The technical pages will be a bit more indepth and are geared towards statisticians, data scientists, and those technical minded looking to assess my thought process.
All other papers are more for a general audience and I assume no prior knowledge.
