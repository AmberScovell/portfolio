Hello. If you are here, this is the overview of my brief portfolio. There are 3 parts.
The first part is giving on overview of how I deal with a difficult situation.
The second part is how I would approach improving a survey. The SF-256 2016 edition is the referenced survey.
The last part is my capstone that I did as part of my master's capstone. Later, I will change it to a project more elegant and refined.
