Hello. If you are here, here is the overview of my brief portfolio. There are 3 parts.
The first part is giving on overview of how I deal with a difficult situation.
The second part is how I would approach an ethics problem in data. Not done yet, will be added by December 2nd.
The last part is my capstone that I did as part of my master's thesis. Later, I will change it to a project more elegant and refined.
