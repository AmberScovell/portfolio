This was a project that focused on dimensions of violence and mental health within high school students. 
Using the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS), the evidence suggests 3 unique subpopulations within high school students with the third group having elevated rates of violence and mental health issues. Latent class analysis was the primary analysis used for this study, though others were used.
This demonstrates my ability to program in R and my skills at communicating complex topics to researchers and laymen.
